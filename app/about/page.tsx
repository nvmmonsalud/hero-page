                    I’m Neil Vincent Monsalud — a marketing strategist, SEO expert, and
                    creative based in Tokyo. With a background in business, photography,
                    and storytelling, I help brands and individuals craft meaningful
                    visual and digital experiences.

                    My work spans from strategic campaigns to portrait, corporate, and
                    commercial photography — blending data-driven insight with creative
                    expression.
